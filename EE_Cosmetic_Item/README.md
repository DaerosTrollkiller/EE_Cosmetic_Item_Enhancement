[A Gibberlings Three Mod](https://www.gibberlings3.net/)

**Author**: [Daeros_Trollkiller](https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/11100-daeros_trollkiller/)


## Introduction

As I have been playing through and enjoying the enahnced editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 2, and Icewind Dale, there are many times where I would obtain a new item, and could'nt wait to see that it would look like on my character, only to be sorely disappointed by how bland or uninspired it looked.  

I thought that certainly I could'nt be the only one who thought this, so I have created this mod to address what I consider to be one of the most overlooked areas of the Enhanced Edtions - Item Cosmetics

## Content

What this mod does:

- Cosmetically enhances existing items within Baldur's Gate:EE, Siege of DragonSpear, Baldur's Gate 2:EE, and Icewind Dale:EE
 - Enhancements can include:
  - New icons
  - New description images
  - New descriptions
  - Equipped appearance
  - Recoloring
  - Pulse and/or solid glows
  - New projectiles
  - New visual animations for hit effects
  
This mod does not alter functionality of any items with very few exceptions:  In cases where I found that an item was obviously broken, I corrected their function if I was able.  Two examples of this are: Shortbow of Gesen, Larloch's Minor Drain (BG2 only).  The projectile for the Gesen bow fires much slower than other arrows, and the HP drain from Larloch's doesnt work in BG2.  This mod fixes those, and a few other minor issues I found.


This mod also contains a seconday, optional component:

- Removes annoying visual effects from equipped items
 - Removes translucencies (shadowed items)
 - Removes spell trap visual effect (cloak of mirroring)
 - Removes physical mirror visual effect (reflection shield +1)
 - Removes blur visual effect (claw of kazgoroth)
 
This component is implemented in a way that does not remove the visual effect from spells which share it, with one minor exception:
 - If a character who is wearing the reflection shield +1 or cloak of mirroring were to cast physical mirror or spell trap, respecitvely, the visual effect from the spell will not show while the respective item is equipped.  However, if the item is removed, the visual effect shows as normal until the spell ends.  I'm not sure why a character wearing one of these items would need to cast those spells, but I wanted to disclose this nonetheless.
