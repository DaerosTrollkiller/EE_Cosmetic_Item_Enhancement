# Enhanced Edition: Cosmetic Enhancements

## Introduction

Ever since I first played Icewind Dale when it was released, I have always been enamored by the audiovisual effects in that game in comparsion to the Baldur's Gate games.  I've also though that items in both games could look alot better than they do in the official releases, so I set out to improve both in this mod!

## Content

What this mod does:

- Cosmetically improves many items in the game.  This can include new icons, recoloring, new projectiles, and addition of pulse and solid glows. *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE*

- Removes annoying visual effects from equipped items. (ex: cloak of mirroring, blur, reflection shield, etc...) *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE* 

- Component to remove all pulse glows from all armor, if desired.  *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE*

- Enhanced on-hit audiovisual effects with several options to customize to the player's liking. This component also fixes the "broken" parts of these effects in the supported games. (Fire, Cold, Electricity, Acid) *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE*

- IWD-style enhanced audiovisual spell effects.  This component also adds much greater variety in types of creatures sommoned by summoning spells, and adds missing water elemental, and water elemental prince, Ben-Hadar, to elemental summoning HLAs. *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET*

- Component for Lightning Bolts to not bounce with two options: pass through targets until hitting a wall or stop at first target. *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE*

- Enhanced animations for several types of monsters. *BG:EE, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE*


All of the components in the mod are optional and may be used independantly of each other.  

The components of this mod affect only the look and sound of items and spells with few exceptions:  In the spell enhancement component, many of the A/V effects are tied to how the spells function in IWD.  A good exmaple of this would be Sol's Searing Orb.  In these instances, I defaulted to the function I felt was most user-friendly. 

For the summoning spells: While the new variety of creatures added to summons may, in some cases, make the spells more useful, I attempted to keep them balanced with the standard version.
